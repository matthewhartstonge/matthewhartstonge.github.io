It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a glorified diffing tool for any cloud resource that, as long as a Terraform Provider exists, can ensure the state of your infrastructure is as expected when written in Hashicorp Config Language (HCL).
As a forewarning before digging deeper, it has been common to hear some Linuxy sysadmin-looking neckbeards in-passing talking about infrastructure as code, better known as IaC, being the bee&amp;rsquo;s knees and how they keep managing to give Dave a good ribbing after causing the Great Network failure of &amp;lsquo;22 after performing a Git force push&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Else Is Evil</title><link>https://blog.mykro.co.nz/posts/2023-05-30-else-is-evil/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 16:00:00 +1200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mykro.co.nz/posts/2023-05-30-else-is-evil/</guid><description>Take the following Go code as an example:

There are a number of things that can cause an issue as code gets maintained over its lifecycle which can be dangerous:</description></item></channel></rss>
